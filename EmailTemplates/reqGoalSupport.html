        Sweet Goals - Request Goal Support [goalTitle]
    </div>
    <div>
        Hi, I'm Dream Chaser from Sweetgoals.com. We have a mutual friend [currentUserEmailAddress].<br>
        <p>
            I'm helping [currentUserName] ([currentUserEmailAddress]) complete their goal [goalTitle]. [currentUserName]
            would like your help too! What we would like you to do is to review [currentUserName]'s
            activities that he does for his goal [goalTitle]. Tell us what you think and give us any
            suggestions that would help [currentUserName] complete [goalTitle]. This should only take about
            five minutes per activity. You also don't have to do anything you don't want to do. It's
            [currentUserName]'s goal they must do the work for it. Your just here to watch, support and give
            advice. You can also quit at anytime.
        </p>

        Here's the specifics about the goal.
        Goal Title: [goalTitle]<br>
        Goal Description: [goalDesc]<br>
        They also sent you a message. It reads:<br>
