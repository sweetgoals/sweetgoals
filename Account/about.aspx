    <h1> Sweet Goals - For The Cause</h1>

    <p> Sweet Goals is designed to help you complete the goals in your life. I hope it helps a lot.  </p>

    <p> The site comes as is. Use at your own risk. If there is a major problem, I'll inform all users. </p>
    
    <p> I will delete anything that I find offensive or could be offensive without warning or notice. I will also lock your 
        account and I may not even tell you about it or be willing to discuss it. Do not put anything that is 
        harmful to anything. When in doubt don't post it!
    </p>

    <p> I can't guarantee the sites security. Don't put anything on the site that you're not comfortable with the whole
        world knowing about. If your a person who's thinking of hacking this site. Please don't. This is my weekened 
        warrior project and there's nothing here anyway. Just some pictures and descriptions of my goals. Plus, I don't have
        a budget and its a goal tracking site. Hacking this site is like ripping off a homless man or something. However, if 
        you do find a security problem feel free to email me and I'll take a look at it. 
    </p>

    <p> If this site helps you and you feel like donating, I would really appreciate it. Thanks.</p>

    <p> Check the blog for updates and how to use the site. </p>
    <p> Oh yeah. One last thing. If your user name or email looks like they were computer generated I&#39;ll lock it out. </p>
    
    <p> This site is dedicated to Violet. I love and miss you very much.</p>
